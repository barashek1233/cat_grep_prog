This is a complex text file.
You should put the number of the line right before it.
Like this line in specific is a third line.
And this line has to be started with the digit "4".
I guess it works properly.
If it's not, start over.
And do not forget to try execute the same command right after its successfull work.
You might find this line starting with two "8" symbols in case it edits the file itself.
9 But like this exact line has to sart with two "9" in it.
So do not forget to fix it if it's wrong!
Work on your code and make it better!

I support you!
